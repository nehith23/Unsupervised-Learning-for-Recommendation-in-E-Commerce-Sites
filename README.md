# Unsupervised-Learning-for-Recommendation-in-E-Commerce-Sites

In the rapidly growing e-commerce world, effectively discerning customer behavior is indispensable for fine-tuning services and bolstering sales. Our research centers around the Online Retail dataset, utilizing unsupervised machine learning to unveil distinct behavioral patterns. Initial data examination was pivotal, ensuring anomalies were addressed, paving the way for reliable
results. The novelty of our approach lies in leveraging the Recency,
Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) methodology, revealing multifaceted behavior of customer interactions. This method demystified
customer activity into recent engagements, purchasing frequency,
and spending magnitude. Utilizing silhouette scores, an optimal
clustering number was identified, followed by the application of
the KMeans algorithm, which correctly segements customers into
discernible behavioral groups. The visualization of these clusters
uncovers clear purchase patterns, providing businesses with a lens
to refine their marketing endeavors. Conclusively, this method
offers businesses an edge, extracting deeper insights into customer
behavior and steering optimal growth trajectories.

## Dataset

The dataset in focus comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a renowned online resource for machine learning datasets and research. Specifically, the ”Online Retail” dataset provides a rich compilation of sales data from an e-commerce business, based primarily in the UK. Each entry in the dataset denotes a specific purchase, detailing essential information like the product description, quantity ordered, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and the country of the customer. This breadth of information makes the dataset an invaluable asset for discerning patterns in online shopping behaviors. With over 500,000 entries, it provides a comprehensive snapshot of the company’s sales and customer interactions. Such a dataset is particularly suitable for our project as it grants a detailed look into the intricacies of e-commerce transactions, offering insights into customer preferences, buying frequency, and expenditure patterns, making it pivotal for understanding and segmenting different customer behaviors.
